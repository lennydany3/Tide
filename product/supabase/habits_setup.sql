-- Tide · Supabase habits setup
--
-- Run after auth_setup.sql: Supabase → SQL Editor → New query → Run.
-- Safe to run again: every statement replaces or skips what already exists.
--
-- What it creates
--   1. public.habits           one row per habit, RLS on, owner-only
--   2. public.habit_entries    one row per habit per day that was ever touched
--   3. table privileges        least privilege on top of RLS
--   4. updated_at triggers
--   5. habits_snapshot()       an account's habits and history in one request
--   6. realtime broadcasts     every change announced on the owner's private
--                              topic, habits:<user id>
--
-- How the app uses it (lib/services/habits/)
--   Every write is the whole row, never a delta ("8 glasses on the 11th", not
--   "+1 glass"), so a write queued offline can be replayed any number of times
--   and a later write to the same row makes an earlier one redundant. Each row
--   carries the `origin` of the app process that last wrote it, so that
--   process can skip the broadcast of its own write.
-- =============================================================================


-- 1. Habits ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The id is made by the app (a v4 UUID), not by the database: a habit created
-- offline needs its id before the server has seen it, so its first day can be
-- queued against it.

  -- { "lead": 10, "style": "call", "tone": "lowTide", "snooze": 10,

  -- an empty object is a valid row — it is what every habit from before this
  -- column reads as.

  -- Every pause the habit has had: [{ "start": "2026-09-10", "end": null }],
  -- oldest first, start inclusive, end exclusive, only the last one open. A
  -- paused day is a rest day for the streak. `paused` is kept equal to "the
  -- last span is open" so builds from before this column still hide it.

-- Columns added after the table first shipped. `create table if not exists`
-- skips a table that is already there, so a project set up from an earlier

-- 2. Entries --------------------------------------------------------------------
-- One row for each day of a habit that has been logged or frozen. `amount` is
-- null for a day with nothing logged; `frozen` means a freeze token was spent
-- on it. Undoing a day writes it back empty rather than deleting it: a delete
-- followed quickly by a re-log could reach another device in the wrong order
-- and erase the re-log there.
--
-- `day` is the person's own calendar date, with no time zone, because that is
-- what a streak counts.

create table if not exists public.habit_entries (
  habit_id   uuid not null,
  user_id    uuid not null default auth.uid(),
  day        date not null,
  amount     numeric check (amount >= 0 and amount <= 1000000),
  frozen     boolean not null default false,
  origin     text check (char_length(origin) <= 64),
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now(),

    on delete cascade
);

create index if not exists habit_entries_user_day_idx
  on public.habit_entries (user_id, day);


-- Row level security ----------------------------------------------------------------
-- A signed-in user reaches only their own rows, in both tables. The composite
-- foreign key above means an entry can only hang off a habit with the same
-- owner, so these policies never need to look across tables.

alter table public.habits        enable row level security;
alter table public.habit_entries enable row level security;

drop policy if exists "habits_select_own" on public.habits;
create policy "habits_select_own"

-- 3. Privileges -----------------------------------------------------------------
-- Whole-table grants rather than per-column ones: the app writes by upsert,
-- and an upsert's ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE needs UPDATE on every column it sends,
-- id and user_id included. The update policy's `with check` is what stops a
-- row being handed to somebody else.

-- 4. updated_at -----------------------------------------------------------------

-- depend on the order the two were run in.

-- 5. habits_snapshot() ------------------------------------------------------------
-- What the app reads on sign-in, on returning to the foreground, on pull to
-- refresh and when the realtime channel joins. One function instead of two
-- selects, for two reasons: it is a single statement, so habits and entries
-- are read at the same instant and an entry can never arrive for a habit the
-- list does not have; and it returns a single value, so PostgREST's row cap
-- (1,000 by default on Supabase) cannot quietly cut a long history short.
--
-- Shape: [ { ...habits row, "entries": [ { "day", "amount", "frozen" } ] } ]
--
-- security invoker: it runs as the caller, under the policies above.

-- 6. Realtime ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Changes reach the owner's other devices as Realtime *Broadcast from the
-- database* rather than as Postgres Changes. Postgres Changes cannot filter or
-- authorise delete events, so every subscriber would be sent every user's
-- deleted rows; a broadcast goes to one topic, and the policy on
-- realtime.messages below lets only its owner join it.
--
-- Entries are announced on insert and update only. The app never deletes one
-- (an undone day is written back empty), so the only entry deletes are the
-- cascade from a deleted habit, and that habit's own delete already says it.
--
-- The app joins with `private: true`. Nothing needs changing in the
-- dashboard: private channels are authorised by these policies whether or not
-- Realtime's "Allow public access" setting is left on.
