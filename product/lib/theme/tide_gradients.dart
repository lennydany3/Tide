/// page, card, row, well, pill, button, title text. When every object ramps,
/// none of them reads as lit; the screen just reads as busy. What survives
/// here is the page ground, one bloom recipe, the glass the tab bar is made
/// of, the accent ramp used *only* inside the tide curve, and the streak
/// flame's fill.

  // variation in the ground — a vertical ramp, a bloom, a vignette — and
  // those rows stop matching what is behind them and appear as a lighter
  // slab down the middle of the screen.

  // the surfaces on it, which is what the palette was rebuilt to allow.
