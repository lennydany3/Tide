/// The rows used to sit directly on the page, on the argument that habits
/// on Home were hairline rows on the ground and Settings should match. That
/// argument has expired: habits are cards now, History and Insights are
/// panels, and Settings on bare ground was the last screen still built the
/// old way — so the thing that was meant to make it look like the same
/// product was the one thing making it look like a different one.
///
/// The hairlines stay, inside the panel, separating rows. The panel is what
/// says the group is a group; the hairlines are what say where one row ends
/// and the next begins. Those are two different jobs and the spacing alone
/// was doing neither of them well.
