/// First run.
///
/// This flow used to be a setup wizard: pick templates, confirm a schedule,
/// approve notifications, done. It asked four questions before it had said
/// what the app was, which is the wrong order — every one of those answers
/// is available inside the product in a screen the user has not yet been
/// given a reason to want. Configuration is not onboarding, it is homework.
///
/// So it explains instead. Seven pages: what Tide is, then the three things
/// it does — log, hold, read — each *performed* on a loop rather than
/// described, then the one question worth asking up front (which palette,
/// because it is the first thing every later launch shows), then what
/// reminders need from the phone, then the hand-off. It writes two things of
/// its own, both kept on the device: the palette, and that it has been seen
/// so no later launch shows it again; the real output of the flow is a user
/// who knows what the swipe does.
///
/// The permission page is the one exception to "no homework", and it is
/// built to feel like none: one thing at a time, each with a reason, "not
/// now" always a full answer, and the footer reads "Skip for now" until
/// every card has had one. A reminder that cannot reach the lock screen is a
/// reminder that does not work, and this is the one moment the phone can be
/// asked without interrupting anything.
///
/// Two affordances the wizard did not need and this does. **Back**, because
/// an explanation you can only move forward through is a slideshow you are
/// trapped in; and **swipe**, because with nothing on the page to fill in,
/// the pages are the content and paging them by hand is the natural
/// gesture. Skip stays exactly where it was and just as legible — a skip
/// that hides is a dark pattern, and it would also be a lie about how much
/// this flow matters.
