/// Logging a habit that has a count, raised as a bottom sheet.
///
/// Held habits used to be logged from the Home row itself: press and hold,
/// and a single fill swept the whole target. That gesture only had two
/// outcomes — release early and log nothing, or hold on and log all ten —
/// which is the wrong shape for a habit whose whole point is that it has
/// parts. It also put a slow gesture on a row you scroll past, so brushing
/// the list logged things.
///
/// Here the count is the subject of its own surface, and one hold banks one
/// unit. You stop when the number is right, which is the thing the sweep
/// never let you do.
///
/// **The redesign.** This was a progress ring with the count inside it and
/// a caption underneath explaining the controls. Three things were wrong
/// with that. The ring is the app's most reused object — it is on every
/// habit card, in the save button, behind the empty state — so the one
/// screen that exists to be *about* a quantity looked like everything else.
/// A ring is also a poor instrument for a count: an arc at 62% does not
/// answer "how many more", it answers "roughly how far", and this screen is
/// only ever open because somebody wants the first answer. And the whole
/// middle of the sheet was spent restating the controls in a sentence.
///
/// What replaces it is a vessel filling up — the level rises, the units are
/// ruled across it, and the figure sits beside it at the size the screen
/// deserves. It is the product's own metaphor stated literally, on the one
/// screen where a literal reading is the useful one, and it leaves the
/// space the caption was using to say the thing that actually matters:
/// how many are left.
///
/// A sheet rather than a pushed screen, for the same reason as the day
/// breakdown: you are still looking at Today, and Today should stay behind
/// it.
