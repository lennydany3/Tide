/// Logging a duration habit: a dial set to the time spent, then one tap.
///
/// Duration habits used to share the counted sheet, where one hold banks one
/// unit. A duration's unit is a minute, so a ninety-minute session cost
/// ninety holds. That sheet makes every unit deliberate on purpose, and on a
/// clock that is exactly the wrong property: nobody lives forty-five minutes
/// of reading as forty-five separate events. They finish, and they know
/// roughly how long it was.
///
/// So the question changes from "one more?" to "how long?", and the
/// instrument changes with it — a clock face is what people already read time
/// off. The dial shows the day's *total*, and nothing is written until the
/// button has said, in words, what will be written.
///
/// **The dial only turns forward.** Its floor is what is already logged, and
/// a finished day is locked. It used to wind back too, which made time that
/// had been marked as done a thing a thumb could quietly take away by sliding
/// the wrong way — and on a streak, "done" has to stay done. Taking time back
/// is still possible, but only as its own named act: [onUndo], behind a
/// control that says what it will remove.
///
/// When the answer is exact — the run app said 47 minutes — dragging to it
/// is fiddly, so the figure in the middle opens a keypad. The keypad lives in
/// the sheet rather than raising the system keyboard, which would cover the
/// very button that writes the time.
