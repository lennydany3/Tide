/// One habit on Home, and the gesture surface for logging it.
///
/// An enclosed card. The list spent a while as full-bleed rows separated by
/// a hairline, on the argument that a panel carried no information the
/// content inside it did not already carry. True, and beside the point: on
/// a near-black ground four hairlines do not read as four objects, they
/// read as ruling on a page, and the habit you are aiming a thumb at has no
/// edge to it. Giving each habit a fill one step off the page, a hairline
/// all the way round and a 20px radius is what makes it a thing you can
/// pick up rather than a line of text with a gesture attached.
///
/// The fill is [TideColors.shelf] rather than the page colour — one step of
/// luminance, no gradient — and it is opaque, which is what still lets the
/// card slide cleanly over the swipe backdrop when it is dragged.
///
/// **Read left to right: what it is, how it has gone, where today stands.**
/// The glyph sits in a tile of its own; the name carries the week and one
/// line of status beneath it; and a single mark at the far end says whether
/// today is open, filling, done or frozen. The card used to put a progress
/// ring *around* the glyph, which fused "which habit" and "how far" into one
/// 34px object, and then end the row on a bare streak figure nothing
/// labelled. Splitting identity from state, and naming the streak where it
/// is shown, is what lets a list of four be scanned rather than decoded.
///
/// The body logs the habit — binary habits are swiped, and a habit with a
/// count opens the log sheet, where its units are metered out one at a
/// time.
///
/// The trailing side of the body reads the day rather than offering one
/// fixed action: an open day is frozen, a frozen day gives its token back,
/// and a day already logged is undone. Undo lives here rather than in a
/// snackbar because it is the *same* gesture reversed — the thing you reach
/// for when a swipe logged a habit you did not mean to log is the swipe
/// back, and a card that has to be found again in a list of four is not
/// where that reach ends up.
///
/// **A long press anywhere on the card** raises the context menu. It used
/// to be reachable only from the ring, which is a 34px target for the one
/// gesture people go looking for when they want to edit or delete
/// something — so in practice the menu was not reachable at all. Long press
/// and horizontal drag settle in the gesture arena on their own (movement
/// picks the drag, stillness picks the press), so the whole card can carry
/// both without the two fighting.
